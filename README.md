# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to help a playwriter who is trying to raise funds for her play, Fever gain a deeper understanding of Crowdfunding campaigns to determine specific factors that make a project campaign successful.  With that understanding, she can mirror those successful campaigns when setting up hers.
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Analysis and Challenges
A challenge I faced was when I was creating the Outcome based on Launch Date pivot table. I was not able to show the various start dates of the campaign. Excel automatically grouped them for me into months.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The most successful campaigns were those which had the least goal targets and the campaigns that failed the most had greater goal target amounts.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
## Results
---
Two conclusions that I drew from the Outcomes based on Launch Date are
-   The most successful campaigns were launched in May and June i.e late Spring
-  The number of cancellation was relatively low throughout the year.
---
A conclusion that I drew from the Outcomes based on Goals chart is
The most successful campaigns were those which had the least goal targets and the campaigns that failed the most had very high amounts as their goal targets.

---
Some limitations of this dataset are
-   It does not take into account the interests of the people making the donations. So we donâ€™t know if they are music lovers, games lovers etc. 
-  The percentage Funded column has just one value of 0 throughout the whole table. That does not give us any useful information.
---
A possible graph that we could create is a graph that shows how the duration of each Crowdfunding campaign can affect the total amount pledged and donated for each campaign. 
You can subtract the Date Ended field from the Date started field to show you how long each campaign lasted. With this information, we can plot the graph to see if the duration of a Crowdfunding campaign can have any impact on the donations.
